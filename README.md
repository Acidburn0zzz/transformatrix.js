# node-transform-matrix [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chrisaljoudi/Queue.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chrisaljoudi/node-transform-matrix)
A lightweight, fast transformation matrix module for node.js and the browser.

## What?

This module enables you to track the transformation matrix of a 2D plane by applying the transformation just as you would on an HTML5 `<canvas>`.

## Installation

```javascript
npm install node-transform-matrix
```

## Usage

First, import with:

```javascript
var Matrix = require("node-transform-matrix");
```

The module provides the following:

### `new Matrix()`
creates and returns a new Matrix initialized to a default, untouched transformation.
### `m.translate(x, y)`
applies a translation to Matrix `m`.
### `m.scale(scaleX, scaleY)`
scales Matrix `m` by `scaleX`, `scaleY`.
### `m.rotate(radians)`
rotates Matrix `m` by the specified number of `radians`.
### `m.inverse()`
returns a Matrix that is the inverse of `m`.
### `m.multiply(n)`
returns a Matrix that is the product of `m` and `n`.
### `m.reset()`
resets Matrix `m` to the default, transformation-free state.
### `m.transformPoint(x, y)`
transforms the point (x, y) through `m` and returns a two-element array `[new_x, new_y]` that represents the resulting point.

## Who made this?

This module was written with care and love by [Chris](https://chrismatic.io/).
